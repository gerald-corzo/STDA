# Drought Analysis 


## Desription
This repository contains a simple library (file) called STDA (Spatial Temoral Drought Analysis)


##  STDA.py

Contains:
1. MonthlyPercentiles 
2. ExtendThresholds
3. SmoothMonth 

---

> In the example you will see that the main function reads a time series data from Excel file
> Then provides uses MonthlyPercentiles to obtain a time series of thresholds (per month)
> Then Smooth performs a moving average to have a smooth threshold for your time series
